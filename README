eglo -- Minimalistic X11/EGL abstraction for Pocket C.H.I.P
===========================================================

This is a minimalistic library to abstract away X11 and EGL API calls
for applications and games intended to run on the Pocket C.H.I.P, so
that one can simply link against libGLESv1_CM or libGLESv2 and start
coding. No utilities, no audio functions, no toys.

Build dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libx11-dev chip-mali-userspace

How to build the library and example app:

    make

How to run the example:

    ./egloapp

For apps that don't work well with the small screen (480x272), you can
set the environment variable EGLO_SCALE to enable the experimental FBO
scaling code, for example:

    env EGLO_SCALE=2 ./egloapp    # Uses virtual screen size 960x544
    env EGLO_SCALE=4 ./egloapp    # Uses virtual screen size 1920x1088
